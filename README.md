# Hockey-Database-with-GUI
Hockey Database (C++) to store stats for a full hockey team. Stats can be added for the whole team or each individual player. All stats are customizable throughout the execution of the program. The database uses file reading and writing to store and retrieve Team stats. At first the application was fully console based; however, after a local hockey team found interest in the idea, a fully GUI was built using Qt. The program will be used in 2016 by the Orleans Blues Hockey Association.  

Setup (console): 
1. Download a C++ IDE. (I have used codeblocks). Download CodeBlocks from: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads

Setup (GUI):
1. Download QT Creator: https://www.qt.io/download/

Note: a functioning executable version of the GUI can be found under the (exe) directory. The program has images; however, I have removed them to avoid copyright issues.
